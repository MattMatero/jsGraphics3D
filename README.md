jsGraphics3D
============

A small graphics engine that can currently create cubes and perform basic operations on them. This was a small project meant to be an introduction to Javascript and to reinforce some topics of matrix operations. To run the program clone the repo and run the testPlane.html file in your browser. It should show a cube rotating around both the X and Y axis.
